I am a post-doctoral researcher in Prof. Karl Gegenfurtner's lab at Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen. My research focuses on visual perception and its underlying neural mechanisms by combining psychophysics, eye-tracking, two-photon calcium imaging, and modeling.

Lights exist everywhere, but how humans perceive the brightness of real-life illuminations is less studied. To address this, I am using LED lamps to measure human brightness perception and their corresponding pupillary responses.
