<font size=5> I am Shuchen Guan (官漱尘), a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Karl Gegenfurtner’s lab at Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen, Germany. My research employs psychophysics (both laboratory and online), eye-tracking, virtual reality, two-photon calcium imaging, and computational modeling to investigate visual perception and its underlying neural mechanisms.

My main research interests focus on **color vision**, particularly heterochromatic brightness—how color information is integrated to influence brightness perception—along with color constancy, hyperspectral imaging, and melanopsin responses. Beyond chromatic processing, I study achromatic visual features such as orientation, spatial frequency, and more complex nonlinear stimuli to better understand how perception arises from neuronal activity.

I am also fascinated by the dynamics of perception, including **serial dependence**, which describes how recent visual experiences bias current perception, and **perceptual learning**, exploring how the visual and auditory systems adapt and interact through training.
 

Interests:
- Color vision: heterochromatic brightness, lights and illuminations, color constancy
- Serial Dependence
- Neural mechanism of vision
- Perceptual learning
- Multisensory integration </font>
